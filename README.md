# Numerical-Methods-For-Computer-Science: Numerical Algorithms Implementation
This repository collects the implementation of numerical algorithms, with several application in different field of artificial intelligence.
This work has been developed during the Numerical Methods For Computer Science course @ [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uniba.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/informatica) @ [University of Bari "Aldo Moro"](http://www.uniba.it/) 
under the supervision of dr. [Francesca Mazzia](https://archimede.dm.uniba.it/~mazzia/mazzia/) and dr. [Antonella Falini](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Antonella-Falini).
